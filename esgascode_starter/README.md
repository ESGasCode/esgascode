# ESG-as-Code™

**ESG-as-Code™** is a legal-technology framework that transforms ESG regulatory standards into machine-readable, executable rules. It is designed to support ESG compliance, auditing, and automation across jurisdictions.

## 🌍 Vision
Enable transparent, traceable, and programmable ESG logic aligned with global standards such as:
- ISSB (IFRS S1/S2)
- SFDR (EU)
- SEC Climate Disclosure (US)
- FCA ESG Ratings Regime (UK)

## 📦 Project Structure
```
rules/
  issb/
    climate.yaml
parser/
  rule_engine.py
examples/
  demo_input_policy.txt
```

## 🚀 Get Started
1. Clone the repo  
2. Edit or extend the rules in YAML format  
3. Run `rule_engine.py` to check a sample ESG disclosure against encoded rules

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- YAML for rule definition
- Python for parsing and logic engine
- GitHub for versioning and open contribution
